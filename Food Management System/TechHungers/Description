This folder contains the progress that I made in creating design for food donation app as a developer before giving my solution to production team to create the final product.
I am a Developer and a Tester in this environment that I shared here.
My app contains request and donate screen.
Request screen means you or anyone else send request to the app that you or someone else is hungry and need food.
Donate screen means that you or someone else give food to the app so that the app stores the food and give it to those hungry people that need it.
If that person already created account in the app, include it in contributor field and fill in the field for donor.
Otherwise, leave that field blank and just fill in the field for donor.
This app includes list of foods that were donated by others.
There's a home screen that contains texts and profile screen that contains information about your profile.
If you want to know who you are or what information you gave to the app, check it out in profile screen.
If you found glitches or errors in this app, just to let you know that I am aware of it and working on solving these problems.
