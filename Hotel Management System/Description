The folder Hotel Management System folder will be used to share progress about the system development.
I decided to work on this system that would help the customer and employee to manage the services provided by the hotel and store the actions taken in the system. 
Once data have been stored from the inputs, the customer and the employees should be able to view their own private details about the hotel. 
The customer and the employees can manage hotel services directly through an app rather than managing it physically through meeting and communication. 
This should help the customer and the employees to save time and effort when managing hotel services.
